**Amazon Clone Frontend**
<br>

This project replicates the design and structure of Amazon's homepage, focusing on responsive layout and interactive components.

ðŸ›’ -I designed the homepage to look similar to Amazon's interface.<br>
ðŸŽ¨ -The project is fully responsive, working well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.<br>
âš¡ -I implemented interactive components such as navigation, sliders, and buttons using JavaScript.<br>
<br><br><br>


**Technologies that I Used** 
<br>
-HTML: To structure the webpage. <br>
-CSS: To style and make the layout visually appealing. <br>

<br> <br> <br>
