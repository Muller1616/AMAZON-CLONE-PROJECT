**Amazon Clone Frontend**

I have built an Amazon Clone frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project replicates the design and structure of Amazon's homepage, focusing on responsive layout and interactive components.

ðŸŽ¨ -The project is fully responsive, working well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
âš¡ -I implemented interactive components such as navigation, sliders, and buttons using JavaScript.



**Technologies that I Used**
